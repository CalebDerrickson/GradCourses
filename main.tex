\section{Problem 1}
For this problem, let $\dot{x} = f(x)$, where $x \in \R$ and $f(x)$ is a $C^1$ function satisfying $f(0) = 0$, i.e. $x = 0$ is an equilibrium. 

\subsection{Problem 1, part a}
Find an $f(x)$ that shows that $x = 0$ may be unstable even though it appears to by Lyapunov stable for the corresponding linearized problem.

\partbreak
\begin{solution}

    For the sake of completion, I will provide the definition of Lyapunov stability.

    \alignbreak
    \vspace{-8mm}
    \begin{quote}
        If $x^*$ is an equilibrium point of the system $\dot{x} = f(x)$, then $x^*$ is Lyapunov stable if for every neighborhood $N$ of $x^*$ there exists a neighborhood $S\subset N$ such that $\forall \ x_0 \in S$, $x(t) \in N \ \forall \ t > 0$.   
    \end{quote}
    \vspace{-8mm}
    \alignbreak

    Our equilibrium point will be at 0, i.e. $f(x^*) = f(0) = 0$, so our function should match accordingly. If we let $f(x) = -sin(x)$, then our linearized problem about $x = 0$ is $\dot{x} = -x$. Thus, for any $x$ on which our function occupies will be attracted to the origin (but never reach it, but we are not examining that in this part). 
    However, we can notice that the non-linear system will have points not attracted to the origin, i.e., any points beyond $x = \pm\pi$. 
\end{solution}

\newpage
\subsection{Problem 1, part b}
Find an $f(x)$ that demonstrates that $x = 0$ may be asymptotically stable even when it is not linearly asymptotically stable.
\partbreak
\begin{solution}

    I will again include the definition of asymptotic stability.

    \alignbreak
    \vspace{-8mm}
    \begin{quote}
        If $x^*$ is an equilibrium point of the system $\dot{x} = f(x)$, then $x^*$ is asymptotically stable if it is Lyapunov stable and there exists a neighborhood $N$ such that if $x_0 \in N$, then $x(t) \rightarrow x^*$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$. 
    \end{quote}
    \vspace{-8mm}
    \alignbreak

    If we take $f(x) = -x^2\sin(x)$, then we see that there exists some neighborhood (roughly in the interval (-2.89, 2.89)) around 0 such that if $x_0 \in (-2.89, 2.89)$, then it will asymptotically approach $x^* = 0$. However, its linear term is zero, thus when solving the differential equation, we see that $x$ can be any constant function. Then the only point which will asymptotically approach $x^* = 0$ is $x_0 = 0$, which is not an open set, thus not Lyapunov stable, so not asymptotically stable. 
\end{solution} 

\newpage
\section{Problem 2}
The proof that linear asymptotic stability implies asymptotic stability in the text (Page 117) has a large number of positive constants introduced in it: $K, \delta, \ep, \alpha$. Describe the role of each in the proof, as well as any restrictions on them, ordering of them, etc. 

\partbreak
\begin{solution}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\alpha$ caps the eigenvalues of $A$ such that $\Re(\lm) < -\alpha < 0$, thereby ensuring all eigenvalues have real part less than zero.
        \item $K \geq 1$ is the bound obtained in Lemma 2.29, which bounds any solution with initial condition within the stable space of $A$. 
        \item $\ep$ and $\delta$ come from the fact that our system $f \in C^1$.
    \end{itemize}

    \jump
    From the above descriptions, their applications in the proof in various ways. In particular, the combination $K\delta$ bounds the distance from our solution to the equilibrium point, i.e., $|y| = |x - x^*| < K\delta$. Furthermore, by Gr\"{o}nwall's Lemma, this distance is further bounded in time by 
    \[
    |x - x^*| \leq K\delta e^{-(\alpha - K\ep)t} 
    \]
    Thus for any $\ep < \alpha K$, our solution is bounded. The proof then concludes with the statement, `` if S is the ball of radius $\delta$, then $N$ is the ball of radius $K\delta$", meaning Lyapunov stability is assured for neighborhood of radius $K\delta$ of our equilibrium $x^*$. 
\end{solution}

\newpage
\section{Problem 3}
Use the Hartman-Grobman theorem to prove that linear asymptotic stability implies asymptotic stability for an equilibrium $\textbf{x}^*$ of $\dot{\textbf{x}} = \textbf{f}(\textbf{x})$, where $\textbf{f}: \R^n \rightarrow \R^n$ is a $C^1$ vector filed. Can you also use it to show linear instability implies instability?

\partbreak

\begin{solution}
    
    Again, for completion, I will include the Hartman-Grobman here:

    \alignbreak
    \vspace{-8mm}
    \begin{quote}
        If $x^*$ is a hyperbolic equilibrium point of the system $\dot{x} = f(x)$, $f \in C^1$ with flow $\ph_t(x)$, the there is a neighborhood $N$ of $x^*$ such that $\ph_t(x)$ is topologically conjugate to its linearization on $N$.
    \end{quote}
    \vspace{-8mm}
    \alignbreak

    Since we are supposing an equilibrium $x^*$ is linear asymptotically stable, then all eigenvalues of the Jacobian $Df(x^*) = A$ has real part less than zero. Thus $x^*$ is a hyperbolic equilibrium of the linearized system. By Hartman-Grobman, we are guaranteed the existence of a neighborhood $N$ of $x^*$ such that the flow $\ph_t(x)$ is topologically conjugate to linearized counterpart $\psi_t(x)$ for any choice $x \in N$. Thus, picking $x_0 \in N$, we can say there exists a homeomorphism $h$ satisfying
    \[
    h(\ph_t(x_0)) = \psi_t(h(x_0)).
    \]

    Thus, we want to show that by our assumption of linearized asymptotic stability, our equilibrium $x_*$ is asymptotically stable. That is, for any $x_0 \in N$, $x(t) \rightarrow x^*$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$, where $x$ is any solution to our nonlinear system. Since $\ph_t(x_0)$ solves our system (as was demonstrated in class, as well as the texts), then we wish to show 
    \[
    \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \ph_t(x_0) = x^*.
    \]
    
    Note that since sour system is linearly asymptotically stable, then $h(x^*) = \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} \psi_t(h(x_0))$. Thus the following steps are justified:

    \alignbreak
    \begin{align}
        h(x^*) &= \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \psi_t(h(x_0)) &\text{(By above.)}\nonumber\\
        &= \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} h(\ph_t(x_0)) &\text{(Hartman-Grobman Theorem.)}\nonumber\\
        h(x^*) &= h(\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \ph_t(x_0)) &\text{(Continuity of $h$.)}\nonumber\\
        \implies x^* &= \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \ph_t(x_0) &\text{($h$ is one to one.)}\nonumber
    \end{align}
    \alignbreak

    \newpage
    Thus, it is shown that linear asymptotic stability implies asymptotic stability. Note linear instability means that there will exist some initial condition $x_0$ inside any neighborhood $N$ such that $\psi_t(h(x_0)) \notin N$ for some $t \in \R$ (note that Hartman-Grobman is still applicable in this case). As such this will imply $h(\ph_t(x_0)) \notin N \iff \ph_t(x_0) \notin N$ for any neighborhood $N$. Thus Linear instability implies instability.   
\end{solution}
