\section{Problem 1}
You work for a cryptocurrency startup. the startup has a supercomputer that can mine two types of coins: CatCoins and DogCoins. The profit from mining these coins varies over time. the profit for mining CatCoins on day $i$ is $c_i > 0$ and the profit for mining DogCoins on day $i$ is $d_i > 0$. There are $k$ days and your goal is to determine what coin to mine on day $i$ for every $i \in \{1, ..., k\}$. However, the computer cannot immediately switch from mining CatCoins to mining DogCoins or vice versa, because each type of coins requires its own software, and it takes 1 day to load it. So, for example, if the computer mines CatCoins on day $i$, it can start mining DogCoins only on day $i+2$ and there will be no profit on day $i+1$. \par

Design a DP algorithm that given numbers $c_1, ..., c_k$ and $d_1, ..., d_k$ finds the maximum profit the startup can get. Please do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define subproblems. 
    \item Define the dynamic-programming table and explain the meaning of its entries. 
    \item Write the initialization step of your algorithm.
    \item Write the recurrence formula for computing the entries of the table.
    \item Explain why the recurrence formula is correct. 
    \item Find the running time of your algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

    $T[i+1] = \max\{current[i+1] + current[i+2], other[i+2]\}?$
\end{solution}

\section{Problem 2}
Convert the following LP to the canonical form. Then write the dual LP
\begin{align*}
    &\text{maximize: } x - w            \\[-1.5ex]
    &\text{subject to}                  \\[-1.5ex]
    & \hspace{19mm} x + y + z \leq 5    \\[-1.5ex]
    & \hspace{19mm} x - z + w = 3       \\[-1.5ex]
    & \hspace{19mm} x \geq 0            \\[-1.5ex]
    & \hspace{19mm} y \geq 0            \\[-1.5ex]
    & \hspace{19mm} z \geq -2           \\[-1.5ex]
    & \hspace{19mm} w \geq 0
\end{align*}
Is this LP feasible? If it is feasible, is it bounded or unbounded? Is the dual feasible? If it is feasible, is it bounded or unbounded?

\section{Problem 3}
In this problem, we will design an algorithm for solving the Minimum Vertex Cover problem in bipartite graphs. Let $G = (X, Y, E)$ be a bipartite graph with parts $X$ and $Y$. Consider the following linear programming formulation of the Minimum Vertex Cover Problem. There is an LP variable $x_u$ for every vertex $ u \in X \cup Y$.
\begin{align*}
    &\text{minimize: } \sum_{u \in X\cup Y} x_u\\[-1.5ex]
    &\text{subject to}\\[-1.5ex]
    &\hspace{19mm} x_u + x_v \geq 1 \text{ for every edge } (u, v) \in E\\[-1.5ex]
    &\hspace{19mm} x_u \geq 0
\end{align*}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that the value of this program is at most the minimum cover size.
    \item Let $\xhat$ be an optimal solution. Prove that $\xhat \in [0, 1]$ for every $u \in X\cup Y$.
    \item Assume additionally that $\xhat$ is a vertex solution. Prove that then $\xhat_u \in \{0, 1\}$. To this end, consider the set of graph vertices $A$:
    \[A = \{ u \in X \cup Y : \xhat_u \neq 0 \text{ and } \xhat_u \neq 1\}.\]
    We need to prove that $A$ is empty. Assume to the contrary that $A$ is not empty. Denote $\ep = \min \{ \xhat_u , 1 - \xhat_u : u \in A\}$. Consider solutions $x'$ and $x''$ defined by
    \begin{equation*}
        x'_u = \begin{cases}
            \xhat_u &\text{if } u \neq A\\
            \xhat_u + \ep &\text{if } u \in A\cap X\\
            \xhat_u - \ep &\text{if } u \in A\cap Y\\
        \end{cases}\quad
        x''_u = \begin{cases}
            \xhat_u &\text{if } u \neq A\\
            \xhat_u - \ep &\text{if } u \in A\cap X\\
            \xhat_u + \ep &\text{if } u \in A\cap Y\\
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    Prove that $x'$ and $x''$ are feasible solutions. conclude that $\xhat$ is not a vertex solution. 
    \item Design a polynomial-time algorithm that solves the Minimum Vertex Cover in bipartite graphs. Assume that you have an LP solver that given a linear program finds an optimal vertex solution $\xhat$.
\end{enumerate}
