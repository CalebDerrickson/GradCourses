\section{Problem 1}
Let $f(x): \R \rightarrow \R$ be an infinitely differentiable function. Let $k(x)$ be the smallest integer that satisfies $f^{(j)}(x) = 0, 1 \leq k \leq k - 1, f^{(k)}(x) \neq 0$ (that is the smallest index of the derivative that is nonzero. Here, $f^{(l)}(x)$ is the $l$-th derivative of $f$ at $x$.

\subsection{Problem 1, Part 1}
Prove that, if $k(x)$ is odd, then $x$ is neither a local minimum nor a local maximum. 
\partbreak

\begin{solution}

    Since $f$ is given as arbitrarily differentiable, Taylor's Theorem can be applied. I will provide the theorem below, for reference.

        Let $k \geq 1$ be an integer and let the function $f :\R \rightarrow \R$ be $k$ times differentiable at the point $a \in \R$. Then there exists a function $h_k : \R \rightarrow \R$ such that 
        \[f(x) = f(a) + f'(a) + \frac{1}{2!}\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}\bigg|_{x = a}(x - a)^2 + ... + \frac{1}{k!}\frac{d^kf}{dx^k}\bigg|_{x = a}(x - a)^k + h_k(x)(x - a)^k,\]
        where $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} h_k(x) = 0.$
    \vspace{-5mm}
    \end{quote}
    \begin{center}\rule{17cm}{0.1mm}\end{center}
    Supposing $k$ is odd, then $k = 2m+1$, for $m \in \N \cup \{ 0 \}$.\footnote{I am writing it like this to avoid ambiguity, since I take the natural numbers without 0.} Not also by assumption, all derivatives of $f$ evaluated at $a$ are zero, thus the Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ is simplified to
    \[
    f(x) = f(a) + f'(a) + \frac{1}{(2m+1)!}\frac{d^{(2m+1)}f}{dx^{(2m+1)}}\bigg|_{x = a}(x - a)^{(2m+1)} + h_{(2m+1)}(x)(x - a)^{(2m+1)}.
    \]
    Assuming we can truncate $f$ (i.e., discard the function $h(x)$) around a neighborhood $U_a$ of $a$, then we can approximate $f(x)$ for $x \in U_a$ as 
    \[
    f(x) \approx f(a) + \frac{1}{(2m+1)!}f^{(2m+1)}(x = a) (x - a)^{(2m+1)}.
    \]
    Thus, we can analyze $f$ according to the extremality of $f(a)$.
    \newpage
    \begin{itemize}[-]
        \item \underline{\textbf{Case 1:}} $ \ f(a)$ is a local minimum.
        
        \hop
        Then $f(x) - f(a) \geq 0$ should be true for all $x \in U_a$. This means $\frac{1}{(2m+1)!}f^{(2m+1)}(x = a) (x - a)^{(2m+1)} \geq 0$, so $(x - a)^{(2m+1)} \geq 0$. Note that this is an odd function, so for points less than $a$, this inequality cannot hold. Thus $f(a)$ cannot be a local minimum.
        
        \item \underline{\textbf{Case 2:}} $ \ f(a)$ is a local maximum.

        \hop
        Then the same argument can be made in the previous case, replacing the inequality with $f(x) - f(a) \leq 0$. Then $(x - a)^{(2m+1)} \leq 0$, and since this is an odd function, we cannot find a neighborhood around $a$ such that this inequality is satisfied for all points within the neighborhood. Thus $f(a)$ cannot be a local maximum.
    \end{itemize}
\end{solution}

\newpage
\subsection{Problem 1, Part 2}
Prove that if $k(a)$ is even, then $a$ is either a strict local minimum or a strict local maximum.  
\partbreak
\begin{solution}

    Given we are in the same environment as in the previous part, we will truncate $f$ so that around a neighborhood $U_a$ of $a$, $f(x)$ can be reasonably approximated as 
    \[f(x \in U_a) \approx f(a) + \frac{1}{(k)!}f^{(k)}(x = a) (x - a)^{(k)}.\]
    Since $k$ is even, it can be expressed as $k = 2m$, for $m \in \N \cup \{0\}$. Then we can analyze $f(a)$ based on the value of $f(x) - f(a)$ Note that the case where $f(x) = f(a)$ is not considered, since this would imply $f^{(k)}(x = a) = 0$, which under our assumption of $k$ cannot happen.

    \begin{itemize}[-]
        \item \underline{\textbf{Case 1:}} $ \ f(x) - f(a) > 0 $. 

        \hop
         This implies $\frac{1}{(2m)!}f^{(2m)}(x = a) (x - a)^{(2m)} > 0$, so $f^{(2m)}(x = a) > 0$, since $\frac{1}{(2m)!}(x - a)^{(2m)} \geq 0$ for any $x \in U_a, m \in \N \cup \{0\}.$ Therefore, since $f^{(2m)}(x = a) > 0$, $a$ is a strict local minimum. 

         \item \underline{\textbf{Case 2:}} $ \ f(x) - f(a) < 0$.

         \hop
         Then $\frac{1}{(2m)!}f^{(2m)}(x = a) (x - a)^{(2m)} < 0$, so $f^{(2m)}(x = a) < 0$, since $\frac{1}{(2m)!}(x - a)^{(2m)} \geq 0$ for any $x \in U_a, m \in \N \cup \{0\}.$ Therefore, since $f^{(2m)}(x = a) < 0$, $a$ is a strict local maximum. 
    \end{itemize}

    Therefore, $a$ can either be a strict local maximum or minimum, depending on the sign of $f(x) - f(a)$.  
\end{solution}

\newpage
\subsection{Problem 1, Part 3}
In the same situation, prove that $a$ is an isolated extremum.
\partbreak
\begin{solution}

    Assuming that $a$ is a local extremum of $f$, then we can apply the first order necessary conditions to get that $f'(a) = 0$. Applying Taylor's Theorem to $f'(x)$ then gives
    \[
    \deriv{f}{x}{1} (x) = \deriv{f}{x}{1} \bigg|_{x = a} + \deriv{f}{x}{2}\bigg|_{x = a} (x - a) + \frac{1}{2!}\deriv{f}{x}{3}\bigg|_{x = a} (x - a)^2 + ... + \frac{1}{(k-1)!}\deriv{f}{x}{k} \bigg|_{x = a} (x - a)^{(k-1)} + h_k(x) 
    \]
    This is allowed in some neighborhood $U_a$ of $a$. Note that all derivatives prior to the $k$-th are zero. Suppose further that $U_a$ also satisfies the approximation performed in the previous parts, such that
    \[
    \deriv{f}{x}{1} (x \in U_a) \approx \frac{1}{(k-1)!}\deriv{f}{x}{k} \bigg|_{x = a}(x - a)^{(k-1)} .
    \]
    Note that if $x' \in U_a$ is an extremum, then $\deriv{f}{x}{1}(x') = 0$. When evaluating $\deriv{f}{x}{1}$ at $x = x'$ and setting it equal to zero, we get
    \[
    \deriv{f}{x}{1}(x') = 0 = \frac{1}{(k-1)!}\deriv{f}{x}{k} \bigg|_{x = a}(x' - a)^{(k-1)}.
    \]
    By assumption, $\deriv{f}{x}{k} (x = a) \neq 0$. We can cancel this out, plus the factor of $(k-1)!$ to get $(x' - a)^{(k-1)} = 0$. This then implies $x' = a$. Thus there are no other extrema within the neighborhood $U_a$, meaning $a$ is an isolated extremum. 
\end{solution}

\newpage
\subsection{Problem 1, part 4}
Give an example where $k(a) = \infty$, (i.e. all derivatives vanish at $a$), but $a$ is a strict isolated local minimum.
\partbreak
\begin{solution}
exp$\big(\frac{1}{x^2}\big)$?

\section{Problem 2}
 As we discussed in class, an important issue in comparing algorithms is the asymptotic order of convergence. This problems exposes several rates of convergence and examples concerning them. I suggest you also read the subsection ``Rates of Convergence” of the Appendix A2 of the textbook (pages 619 - 620 in the 2006 edition). The following points refer to the textbook problem numbering. 
 
 \subsection{Problem 2.13}
 Show that the sequence $x_k = 1/k$ is not Q-linearly convergent, though it does converge to zero. (This is called \textit{sublinear convergence}.)
 \partbreak
 \begin{solution}
 
     Plugging in the sequence to the definition of Q-convergence, we get
     \[
     \frac{1/(k+1)}{1/k} = \frac{k}{k+1} = 1 - \frac{1}{k+1},
     \]
     where the limit $x^* = 0$. By definition also, we require the ratio to be bounded by a number $r \in (0, 1)$ for all $k$. Note the ratio found above limits to 1, for any $r \in (0, 1)$ we can always find a $k$ such that the ratio is larger than $r$, thus $x_k = 1/k$ is not Q-linearly convergent.
 \end{solution}

 \newpage
 \subsection{Problem 2.14}
 Show that the sequence $x_k = 1 + (0.5)^{2^k}$ is Q-quadratically convergent to 1.
 \partbreak
 \begin{solution}

     If we consider the sequence $x_k$ to be a summation of two sequences, namely $y_k = 1, z_k = (0.5)^{2^k}$, then $y_k$ converges to 1. Note that $z_k$ is a subsequence of the sequence $z'_k = (0.5)^k$, which was shown in class to limit to zero, thus $z_k$ limits to zero. Since $x_k$ is a summation of converging sequences, then its limit is just the sum of the limits of the individual sequences, so $x_k \rightarrow 1$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. \par 
     
     Plugging this into the definition for Q-quadratic convergence, we see
     \[
     \frac{|1 + (0.5)^{2^{(k+1)}} - 1|}{|1 + (0.5)^{2^k} - 1|^2} = \frac{(0.5)^{2^{(k+1)}}}{(0.5)^{2^{(k+1)}}} = 1.
     \]
     Note that the bound need to just be a positive constant, so setting $M = 1$, we see that the sequence $x_n$ is Q-quadratically convergent.
 \end{solution}

 \newpage
 \subsection{Problem 2.15}
 Does the sequence $x_k = 1/k!$ converge Q-superlinearly? Q-quadratically?
 \partbreak
 \begin{solution}

     It's easy to see $x_k \rightarrow 0$ as $ k \rightarrow \infty$. Checking the sequential ratio gives
     \[
     \frac{x_{k+1}}{x_k} = \frac{1/(k+1)!}{1/k!} = \frac{k!}{(k+1)!} = \frac{1}{k+1}
     \]
     Therefore, the ratio limits to zero as $k \rightarrow \infty$ meaning $x_k$ is Q-superlinearly convergent. For Q-quadratic convergence,
     \[
     \frac{x_{k+1}}{x_k} = \frac{1/(k+1)!}{(1/k!)^2} = \frac{(k!)^2}{(k+1)!} = \frac{k!}{k+1}
     \]
     This is not bounded above by any $M > 0$, so the sequence is not Q-quadratic convergent.
 \end{solution}

 \newpage
 \subsection{Problem 2.16}
 Consider the sequence $x_k$ defined by 
 \[
 x_k = \begin{cases}
     (\frac{1}{4})^{2^k}, &$k$ \text{ even},\\
     (x_{k-1}) / k, &$k$ \text{ odd.}
 \end{cases}
 \]
 Is the sequence Q-superlinearly convergent? Q-quadratically convergent? R-quadratically convergent?
 \partbreak
 \begin{solution}
 
     It's easy to see that $x_k \rightarrow 0$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. We just need to check each Q-convergence.

     \begin{itemize}
         \item \underline{Q-superlinear}:

        \hop
        For $k$ even,
        \[
        \frac{x_{k+1}}{x_{k}} = \frac{x_{k}/(k+1)}{x_k} = \frac{1}{k+1}.
        \]
        For $k$ odd, 
        \[
        \frac{x_{k+1}}{x_k} = k\frac{x_{k+1}}{x_{k-1}} = k\frac{(0.25)^{2^{k+1}}}{(0.25)^{2^{k-1}}} = k\frac{(1/256)^{2^{k-1}}}{(1/4)^{2^{k-1}}}.
        \]
        Although the odd ratio is not as simple as the even ratio, we can see it goes to zero rapidly, as the numerator decreases faster then the denominator, the multiple of $k$ does not change this much. Thus the sequence $x_k$ is Q-superlinear. 

        \item \underline{Q-quadratic}:

        \hop
        For $k$ even,
        \[
        \frac{x_{k+1}}{(x_k)^2} = \frac{x_k / (k+1)}{(x_k)^2} = \frac{1}{x_k(k+1)}.
        \]
        Since the sequence limits to zero, there is no chance that there is a bound for the even sequences. Thus there is no need to check the odd sequences, since we cannot find a bound $M>0$ for the even sequences.

        \item \underline{R-Quadratic}:

        \hop
        With inspiration form Problem 2.14, we notice that $y_k = (0.5)^{2^k} > x_k$ for all k. Note we don't have to worry about absolute values and limits since both sequences limit to zero. We can show this explicitly:

        \hop
        For $k$ even, 
        \[
        x_k = (0.25)^{2^k} = (0.5)^{2\cdot 2^k} = (0.5)^{2^{(k+1)}} < (0.5)^{2^k} = y_k
        \]
        
        \hop
        for $k$ odd, 
        \[
        x_k = \frac{(0.25)^{2^{(k-1)}}}{k} = \frac{(0.5)^{2\cdot 2^{(k-1)}}}{k} = \frac{(0.5)^{2^k}}{k} < (0.5)^{2^k} = y_k
        \]
        \newpage
        We can then show that $y_k$ is Q-quadratically convergent.
        \[
        \frac{y_{k+1}}{y_k} = \frac{(0.5)^{2^{(k+1)}}}{((0.5)^{2^{k}})^2} = \frac{(0.5)^{2^{(k+1)}}}{(0.5)^{2^{(k+1)}}} = 1
        \]
        Therefore, setting $M = 1$, we see that $y_k$ is quadratically convergent, thus $x_k$ is R-quadratic.
     \end{itemize}
 \end{solution}
