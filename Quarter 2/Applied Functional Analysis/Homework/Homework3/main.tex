\section{Problem 5.3}
Let $\delta: C([0, 1]) \rightarrow \R$ be the linear functional that evaluated an function at the origin: $\delta(f) = f(0)$. If $C([0, 1])$ is equipped with the sup-norm,
\[\norm{f}_1 = \int_0^1 |f(x)| \ dx,\]
show that $\delta$ is unbounded.
\partbreak
\begin{solution}
    
    Note that $\delta f \in \R$, so $|\delta f| = |f(0)|$. By definition, $|f(0)| \leq \sup_{x \in [0, 1]} |f(x)| = \norm{f}_\infty$. Then 
    \[
   \norm{\delta} = \sup \frac{\norm{\delta f}}{\norm{f}_\infty} = \sup \frac{|f(0)|}{\norm{f}_\infty} = \sup \frac{|f(0)|}{\sup |f(x)|} \leq 1
    \]
    This implies that $\delta$ is bounded. To compute the norm, we just need to find a function that achieves its max value at $x = 0$. The simplest case is to take $f$ be a nonzero constant function, i.e. $f(x) = 2$ for all $x \in [0, 1]$. Then $|f(0)| = 2$, and $\sup |f(x)| = |f(0)| = 2$. Then $\norm{\delta} = 1$.

    To show that when $C([0, 1])$ equipped with the one-norm makes $\norm{\delta}$ unbounded, we can consider the family of functions 
    \[\mathbb{O} = \{ \{1 - nx : x \in \left[0, \frac{1}{n}\right], \text{else } 0\}, n \in \N\}.\]
    Taking a memeber of that family, we can note that $\norm{\delta f} = |f(0)| = 1$, and
    \[\norm{f}_1 = \int_0^1 |f(x)| = \int_0^\frac{1}{n} 1 - nx \ dx = \frac{1}{2n}\]
    This implies $\norm{\delta} = \sup \{2n\} = \infty$, which is unbounded.

\section{Problem 5.7}
Find the kernel and range of the linear operator $K: C([0, 1]) \rightarrow C([0, 1])$ defined by 
\[ Kf(x) = \int_0^1 \sin\left( \pi (x - y)\right)f(y) \ dy.\]
\partbreak
\begin{solution}

    In finding the kernel of this functional, we need to find all functions such that
    \[-\int_0^1 e^{-\pi(x - y)} f(y) \ dy = \int_0^1 e^{-i\pi(x - y)}f(y) \ dy\]
    As a first suggestion, since the transformation $y \rightarrow -y$ in the right integral transforms it to the first integral with the upper bound being -1, we can first try an even function on $[0, 1]$. As a first guess, we can try $f(y) = \cos(\pi y)$. But when checking this, we see that 
    \[\int_0^1 \sin \left( \pi(x - y)\right)\cos(\pi y) \ dy = \frac{1}{2}\sin(\pi x)\]
    This is obviously not zero. the kernel is a functions orthogonal to cosine (pi x) and sine (pi x).
